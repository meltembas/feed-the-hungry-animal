## 🚜 About The Project
This is a top-down arcade survival game where your only weapon is a pepperoni pizza.

You are a farmer standing your ground against a stampede of hungry animals. They come from the forest at random intervals and different speeds. Your goal? Feed them all. If even a single hungry animal gets past you, it's **Game Over**.

**Core Mechanics:**
* **Random Chaos:** Animals spawn at unpredictable times. You can never get comfortable.
* **Variable Speeds:** Some animals stroll, others sprint. You need quick reflexes to prioritize targets.
* **Projectile Physics:** Time your pizza throws perfectly to intercept the moving targets.
* **One Life:** No health bars. One mistake and the farm is lost.

## 🕹️ Controls
Simple arcade controls.

| Key | Action |

## 🛠️ Built With

## 🚀 How to Play
1.  **Clone the repo** and open in Unity.

## ⚠️ Developer Notes
* The game uses a custom **Spawn Manager** script to handle the randomization of animal waves.
* Collision detection handles the "feeding" logic (destroying the object upon contact with the pizza).

---
*No animals were harmed in the making of this game. They were just very well fed.*
